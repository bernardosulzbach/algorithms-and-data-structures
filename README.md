# Algorithms and Data Structures

## Why this project?

As I teach myself about algorithms and data structures I like to implement them in a simple and readable way.
I used to place solutions to some competitive programming problems among these files and that's why my old algorithms and data structures repository was private in Bitbucket.
Now that I will only keep the theory part and not any solutions to specific problems, I've decided to use a public GitHub repository.

## Can I use the code in my system?

Yes, but I wouldn't recommend it. This is didactic material and not industrial-strength algorithm and data structures implementations.
